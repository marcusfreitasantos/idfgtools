# IDFG

This project is a CRUD for a school called IDFG.

## About the project

The goal here is to make a CRUD where the company can manage their equipments, PCs and Tablets that teachers use every day. With this system they will be able to register their tools and equipments, register users as teachers and managers, check who is keeping the tool and when they take it. The application is still in process and I am building it with ReactJS for the frontend and Wordpres Rest API for the backend. I'm also using bootstrap in order to get things done faster.

## Built with

ReactJS | Redux | Bootstrap | Wordpress Rest API
